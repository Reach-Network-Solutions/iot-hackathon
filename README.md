## TEAM 2: PROJECT OBJECT DETECTION
### ABSTRACT
Out project was aimed at replicating a car with proximity sensors that detect when an object is close to the car. When an object is closer to the car at a certain range, the leds flashes, the motor stops. This enables the driver to avoid crashes. 

### DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
* VS Code
* Python Programming language
* RPi python Liblary

### COMPONENTS
```Raspbery Pi ``` a tiny and affordable computer that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects that acts as our micro computer.

```LEDS ``` is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.

```Ultrasonic sensor``` is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.

```2 Channel Relay Module```is a relay interface board, it can be controlled directly by a wide range of microcontrollers such as Arduino, AVR, PIC, ARM and so on. It uses a low level triggered control signal (3.3-5VDC) to control the relay. It acts as our switch
